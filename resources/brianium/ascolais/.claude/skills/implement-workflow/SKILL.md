# Component Implementation Workflow

End-to-end workflow for implementing components from specs to production.

## Steps

1. **Run `/specs implement`** to identify the next spec to work on
2. **Use `/component-iterate`** to develop the component
3. **Use `/clojure-eval`** for REPL interaction
4. **Update CLAUDE.md** with component reference when done
5. **Commit** means: commit to component library with tsain AND git
